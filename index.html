            <p>The music of Epirus, in the northwest of Greece contains folk songs that are mostly pentatonic and polyphonic, sung by both male and female singers. Distinctive songs include lament songs, shepherd's songs and drinking songs. The clarinet is the most prominent folk instrument in Epirus, used to accompany dances, mostly slow and heavy. The polyphonic song of Epirus constitutes one of the most interesting musical forms, not only for the east Mediterranean and the Balkans, but also for the worldwide repertoire of the folk polyphony like the yodeling  of Switzerland. Except from its scale, what pleads for the very old origin of the kind is its vocal, collective, rhetorical and modal character.</p>
            <p>The corresponding dances are slow and stately; they are invariably danced in counterclockwise circles. Women's dances are especially noble, allowing for a minimum of leg and arm movement, and calling for formal traditional attire: ankle-length black coats, gold thread tuques with a single long tassel, and hammered gold jewelry.</p>
